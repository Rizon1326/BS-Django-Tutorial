Certainly! Let me explain the difference between `BaseUserManager`, `AbstractUser`, and `AbstractBaseUser` in Django, along with when and why to use them.

### 1. **`BaseUserManager`**
   - **Explanation**: This is a helper class provided by Django for creating custom user models. The `BaseUserManager` class is used to define custom manager methods for creating users and superusers.
   - **Why use it**: When you're creating a custom user model, you need a custom manager to handle the creation of users, since the default manager won't work with a custom model. `BaseUserManager` helps you manage user creation tasks such as creating normal users and superusers.

   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import BaseUserManager

     class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
         def create_user(self, email, username, password=None):
             if not email:
                 raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
             email = self.normalize_email(email)
             user = self.model(email=email, username=username)
             user.set_password(password)
             user.save(using=self._db)
             return user

         def create_superuser(self, email, username, password=None):
             user = self.create_user(email, username, password)
             user.is_admin = True
             user.save(using=self._db)
             return user
     ```

   - **When to use**: 
     - You create this class when you have a **custom user model** (e.g., you want to use **email** instead of **username**).
     - It provides functions to handle user creation like `create_user()` and `create_superuser()`.
     - If you're working with a custom user model and you need to customize the creation process, this is where you'll define it.

### 2. **`AbstractBaseUser`**
   - **Explanation**: `AbstractBaseUser` is a class that provides the basic functionality needed for a custom user model in Django, but it doesn’t include fields like `username`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc. You need to add those fields manually when you inherit from `AbstractBaseUser`. This class only includes essential features, such as password hashing and authentication methods, but does **not** provide any of the basic user fields.
   
   - **Why use it**: You use `AbstractBaseUser` when you want to create a **completely custom user model** from scratch and you want to control which fields should exist in the user model. If you don’t need any of the default fields provided by `AbstractUser`, use this class.

   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager
     from django.db import models

     class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
         def create_user(self, email, username, password=None):
             if not email:
                 raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
             email = self.normalize_email(email)
             user = self.model(email=email, username=username)
             user.set_password(password)
             user.save(using=self._db)
             return user

         def create_superuser(self, email, username, password=None):
             user = self.create_user(email, username, password)
             user.is_admin = True
             user.save(using=self._db)
             return user

     class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser):
         email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
         username = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
         first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
         last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
         is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
         is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)

         objects = CustomUserManager()

         USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'  # We use email for authentication
         REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['username']  # Fields required when creating a superuser

         def __str__(self):
             return self.email

         def has_perm(self, perm, obj=None):
             return True

         def has_module_perms(self, app_label):
             return True

         @property
         def is_staff(self):
             return self.is_admin
     ```

   - **When to use**: 
     - Use `AbstractBaseUser` when you want **full control** over the fields in your user model and don’t want the default fields (`username`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`).
     - This is typically used when you want to customize the user model completely (for example, using **email** instead of **username** for login).

---

### 3. **`AbstractUser`**
   - **Explanation**: `AbstractUser` is a fully fleshed-out model that extends `AbstractBaseUser` and adds fields like `username`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `is_active`, `is_staff`, and more. It is the **default model for user authentication in Django**. If you don't need to make drastic changes to the user model but just want to customize some fields, you can inherit from `AbstractUser`.
   
   - **Why use it**: Use `AbstractUser` when you want to customize the user model but still want to keep all the built-in fields (like `username`, `email`, etc.) and methods (like `is_staff`, `is_active`, etc.). It's a great option if you need **minor customizations** but don’t want to start from scratch.

   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

     class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
         pass  # Add custom fields if needed, or use as is
     ```

   - **When to use**:
     - If you want to **extend the default user model** but not change the core fields too much.
     - If you're building an application where the built-in `username`, `email`, and password fields work for your use case, but you might want to add a few more fields or methods.

### Key Differences

| Class              | Purpose                                                                                              | When to Use                                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`AbstractBaseUser`**  | Provides basic functionality for user authentication but does **not** include any default fields.        | Use when you want a **completely custom user model** with full control over the fields. |
| **`AbstractUser`**      | Inherits from `AbstractBaseUser` and adds built-in fields (`username`, `email`, etc.). Ideal for most use cases.  | Use if you want to customize the default user model but still use most of the built-in fields. |
| **`BaseUserManager`**   | Helper class to manage user creation, such as handling `create_user()` and `create_superuser()`.        | Use when creating a custom user model to define how users should be created. |

---

### Summary

- **`AbstractUser`**: Best for most use cases if you need to slightly modify the default user model (e.g., adding custom fields while keeping `username` and `email`).
- **`AbstractBaseUser`**: Best for when you want full control over the user model and need to completely design it (e.g., if you want to replace `username` with `email`).
- **`BaseUserManager`**: Used to define custom logic for creating users and superusers when using a custom user model.
